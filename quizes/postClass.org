#+TITLE: Post-Class Quiz: Weather Visualization in Python GUI Applications

*Instructions:* Select the best answer for each question. Use what you've learned about class design, Tkinter, matplotlib, and reusable components.

1. What is the main advantage of using a separate class like `WeatherChartComponent` in a Python GUI project?
A) It makes the GUI look more colorful  
B) It avoids importing matplotlib  
C) It promotes code reuse and cleaner organization  
D) It eliminates the need for Tkinter frames  

2. In a line chart created using matplotlib, which argument controls the appearance of circular markers on data points?
A) `bar_width`  
B) `linewidth`  
C) `marker`  
D) `alpha`  

3. Which method is used in Tkinter to insert a matplotlib chart into a GUI frame?
A) `embed_chart()`  
B) `canvas.show()`  
C) `FigureCanvasTkAgg().pack()`  
D) `display_chart()`  

4. In the weather dashboard project, what is the purpose of `self.chart_frame.winfo_children()` in `clear_chart_frame()`?
A) It removes the chart background  
B) It finds all subplots in a figure  
C) It lists all widgets in the chart frame for cleanup  
D) It returns temperature and humidity data  

5. If you want to annotate each data point in a bar chart with a numeric value, which method should you use?
A) `ax.annotate()` inside a loop  
B) `ax.plot_text()`  
C) `canvas.annotate_all()`  
D) `fig.label_data()`  

6. Which of the following is **true** about `FigureCanvasTkAgg` in the GUI context?
A) It is a Tkinter-native widget for drawing bar charts  
B) It allows embedding matplotlib figures in a Tkinter frame  
C) It replaces the need for `plt.show()`  
D) Both B and C
